    From drive-by purse
        snatchers to identity thieves to much more dangerous criminals like kidnappers and sex
        traffickers, there's always some story in the news about someone taking advantage of travelers.
        So far in my travels, I've never had any serious problems, thank goodness, and the vast majority of
        travelers will never fall victim to anything more serious than pick-pocketing. Even so, I always keep these
        safety practices in mind when I travel, and I recommend you do, too.
        If you're planning your next trip and wondering how to travel safely, look no further than these 15 simple
        and straightforward travel safety tips for your ultimate safe travel guide.

    <div class="color"><i> 1. Don't wear flashy jewelry</i></div>
    Avoid wearing jewellery and high end clothing. <br>Wearing expensive, flashy jewelry is one sure way to make yourself an obvious target for robbery. Leave it
    at home, friends, especially if you plan to travel to crowded areas!

    <div class="color"> <i>2. Drink responsibly</i></div>
    This has to be one of the most important safety tips for travelers.

    Lots of people enjoy exploring the local nightlife while traveling, and there's nothing wrong with that. But
    keep in mind that it's even more important than ever to drink responsibly when you're traveling.

    When you're away from home youâ€™re more likely to get lost or end up in a dangerous neighborhood, and being
    obviously drunk makes you an easy target for scams, robbery, or worse.

    Oh, and ladies, never forget the golden rule of safe drinking in public: keep an eye on your drink at all
    times!

    <div class="color"><i>3. Be smart about your money</i></div>
    Any solid resource of travel safety information will tell you that it's never a good idea to carry huge
    amounts of cash. Instead, open an account with an international bank or credit card company so you can use
    local ATMs. If you absolutely must withdraw large amounts of cash at once, leave the bulk of it locked up
    safely in your hotel or hostel and carry only what you'll need for the day.

    When using ATMs, try to use only those that are attached to banks as these are less likely to have been
    tampered with by scammers.

    Never keep all of your money in one place. Keep cash and credit cards in two or three different places so
    that if one of your stashes is stolen you aren't left completely empty-handed.

    <div class="color"> <i>4. Be aware of popular scams</i></div>
    Research the place you're visiting to see what the local scammers are up to. Scams range from RFID scanners
    to ploys using children to play on your sympathy. You'll be less likely to fall for these scams if you've
    heard about them ahead of time.

    <div class="color"><i> 5. Know the phone number for emergency services</i></div>
    Be sure to look up the emergency services number for your destination, even before you get there. It's also
    a good idea to look up the number for your country's nearest embassy before you leave. Write them down or
    save them in your phone so you'll have quick access to them in the event of an emergency.

    <div class="color"> <i>6. Use the right bag</i></div>
    Cross-body bags are safer than shoulder or hand bags and can prevent people from grabbing your bag as they
    run or drive by. There are tons of bags made specifically for travelers with features such as slash-proof
    straps, RFID blockers, and locking zippers. Invest in a good bag that suits your needs and preferences.

    <div class="color"><i> 7. Bring travel locks and use them</i></div>
    You can save a few bucks by coming prepared with your own lock if you plan to stay in a hostel. Even if
    you're not staying in a hostel, having a travel lock that can secure your bag to your seat or chair while
    dining or in transit will help keep your valuables safe from theft.

    <div class="color"><i> 8. Keep digital copies of important documents</i></div>
    When traveling, your passport may be the most valuable thing you carry. In the event of a stolen passport,
    having a digital copy will help make the process of getting a replacement easier.

    <div class="color"><i> 9. Try to blend in</i></div>
    Tourists tend to carry larger amounts of cash and valuables and are more vulnerable to scams. Try to avoid
    being an obvious tourist. Try not to draw attention to the fact you are a visitor. Dress modestly and wear clothing that is culturally appropriate. 

    Dress as the locals do, don't stop abruptly in the middle of busy streets to take photos, and even when
    you're lost try not to make it apparent. If you need to ask for directions or consult a map, step inside a
    shop or cafe to do so.

    <div class="color"> <i>10. Use reputable transportation companies</i></div>
    Research which taxi companies are reputable before you arrive in a place, and use only those. If you're
    ride-sharing using an app like Uber or Lyft, double check your driver's vehicle information and verify their
    name before you get in the car with them.

    <div class="color"><i> 11. Check in with friends and family often</i></div>
    Before you leave let someone know your itinerary, and update them to any changes of plans. Make a habit of
    checking in with a close friend or family member back home at the end of each day.

    I know this can seem like a hassle, but ultimately it's better to be safe than sorry. If something terrible
    were to happen, you'll get help faster if someone knows where you were supposed to be that day.
