            Do you want to enjoy high comfort and world-class service during your flight? Do you dream of traveling in a higher class at an attractive price? Submit your proposal to the call for proposals and gain access to the LOT Upgrade service. <br>

            How it works?
            If you already have a ticket booked but would like to travel in a higher class, you can access the LOT Upgrade offer in the automatic offer competition. To do this, log into “Manage Booking” by entering your reservation number and your last name. If the LOT Upgrade service is available for your flight, you will have access to an automatic call for proposals for this service.
            <h2><i>What you need to know</i></h2>

LOT Upgrade benefits are not available on all flights. <div class="i"><img src="img\cab.jpg" alt=""></div>
The number of places available in the offer is limited.
The automatic LOT Upgrade service applies to all passengers specified in the booking. <br>
The offer you place for 1 person will be automatically multiplied by the number of passengers in the booking.
When using LOT Upgrade, the terms of the original fare, including baggage allowance, remain unchanged <br>
The LOT Upgrade proposal competition takes just a few simple steps. <br>
<h4>Step 1:</h4> Enter the amount you want to pay to upgrade to your chosen class. You can make an offer no later than 24 hours before departure.

 <br><h4>Step 2:</h4> Enter your credit card information. Your credit card will only be charged if your offer is accepted.

 <br><h4>Step 3:</h4> The correct placement of your offer will be confirmed by email. If you change your mind at least 24 hours before departure, you can change or cancel your offer using the link provided in the email.

 <br><h4>Step 4:</h4> At least 23 hours before departure, you will receive an email letting you know if your offer has been accepted.

            <h2><i>Dishes and drinks</i></h2>
            The highest quality food is served on board our aircraft. If you have special dietary or religious requirements, we can offer you a range of special meals to suit your needs. Check out also the offer of dishes we serve on short- and long-haul flights. How about a snack? You are sure to find something for yourself at LOT Sky Bar!
            <div class="i"><img src="img\jose-ignacio-pompe-s-Z-h0fEiBM-unsplash.jpg" alt=""></div><br>We offer fresh coffee, tea, juices, water and soft drinks, as well as complimentary snacks on flights over 250 miles.
            You can buy alcoholic beverages including beer, wine and liquor on domestic flights over 250 miles. Snacks are available on flights over 1,300 miles, about 3 hours or more. Selections may vary and limited quantities are available.

Special meals to meet specific dietary, medical and religious needs are available on select flights. To make sure we can accommodate your needs, request your meal starting 30 days before and no later than 24 hours before takeoff. <br>
<br>Although we don’t serve peanuts, we do serve other nut products (such as warmed nuts) and there may be trace elements of unspecified nut ingredient, including peanut oils, in meals and snacks. Additionally, other customers can bring peanuts or other tree nuts on board.

We can’t accommodate requests to not serve certain foods or to provide nut “buffer zones.” Our planes are cleaned regularly, but can’t guarantee the removal of nut allergens on surfaces or in the air filters. Because of this, we can’t guarantee you won’t be exposed to peanuts or other tree nuts during flight, and we strongly encourage those with allergies to take all necessary medical precautions before flying.
